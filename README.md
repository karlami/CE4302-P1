# CE4302-P1

# This is the high-level program prototype for audio signal processing
# using FIR filtering.

# It makes use of a vector_generator function to generate the input signal that satisfy
# the requirements of input vector equivalent to 5s of sound
# considering a sampling frequency of 44.1KHz getting the first 10 values
